description: "Krusty Katering is hemorrhaging money, and Mr. Krabs has brought you in to fix it.
You have 10 line cooks, and while they're okay at making Krabby patties, they can't agree on who cooks what and when.
To make matters worse, Squidward (trying to keep his job) refuses to give you the list of orders, and will only tell you them one by one.
Each time Squidward tells you a job, you get to add it to a cook's schedule for the day.
Cooks cannot trade jobs, once it's on the schedule, it stays there.
You want to ensure the last order finishes as soon as possible so that Mr. Krabs can close and count his profits.

The competing Plankton's Provisions assigns their jobs randomly.
So long as your crew is 20% more efficient than Team Chum Bucket every day this week, you're hired.
Can you save Mr. Krabs' business?"
