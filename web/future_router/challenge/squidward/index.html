      <h2>Squidward Tentacles: Artist, Musician, and Unappreciated Genius</h2>
      <img src="squidward_painting.png" alt="Squidward's painting">
      <p>Welcome to my humble corner of the internet. Here, you'll find a glimpse into the artistic mind of Squidward Tentacles. I am a classically trained clarinet player, a visionary painter misunderstood by the masses, and a next-door neighbor unfortunately plagued by... well, you know who lives next door. 
      This website serves as a refuge from the chaos, a place to showcase my talents, and perhaps even a beacon of hope for other misunderstood artists.</p>
