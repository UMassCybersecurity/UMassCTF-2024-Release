description: "I picked up another signal coming from a Bikini Bottom computer, but this time it is full of noise, it's spectrum is all spreadout. Can you help me demodulate it?

(The signal has been shifted to baseband. The signal contains an english sentence repeated several times. Enter the key as `UMASS{<some_sentence_here>}`, where everything between the angle brackets has been replaced with the lowercase version of the sentence that was transmitted. Example if `Hello_there` was transmitted the key would be `UMASS{hello_there}`)."
