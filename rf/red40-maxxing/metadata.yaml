description: "I picked up this signal coming from a Bikini Bottom computer, but I have no idea what it means. Can you help me demodulate it?

(The signal has been shifted to baseband. The signal contains an english sentence repeated several times. Enter the key as `UMASS{<some_sentence_here>}`, where everything between the angle brackets has been replaced with the lowercase version of the sentence that was transmitted. Example if `Hello_there` was transmitted the key would be `UMASS{hello_there}`)."
